# Restaurant Reviews App


## Project Overview

The **Restaurant Reviews** project is a mobile-ready web application. It is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It also provides a seamless offline experience for its users.

### How to load the project

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python can be used to do this which is already installed on most computers.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

### Areas to check
1. Responsive: using your browser's Developer tools
2. Accessible: good option is to use `chromeVox`
3. Offline access: using developer tools (Application tab)
